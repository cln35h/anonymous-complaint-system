# Anonymous Complaint System

## Overview

The **Anonymous Complaint System** is designed to provide a platform for students to voice their concerns anonymously. This online system enables students to submit complaints or grievances, ensuring their privacy and confidentiality. The system allows students to select the appropriate committees for their complaints and facilitates the transfer of complaints between committees for resolution. Real-time tracking of complaints and a user-friendly interface ensure an efficient and effective complaint management process.
